# Energy Consumption Trend Analysis with Power BI

## 📊 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive dashboard built using **Power BI** to analyze and visualize **energy consumption trends** over time. It helps stakeholders understand key usage patterns, identify high consumption areas, and make informed decisions to reduce energy waste and optimize consumption.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Monitor and visualize energy usage across different time periods.
* Identify peak consumption hours, days, or seasons.
* Spot anomalies or sudden spikes in energy consumption.
* Provide actionable insights for energy efficiency improvements.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Power BI** – for dashboard creation and data visualization
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – for custom measures and KPIs
* **Power Query Editor** – for data transformation and cleaning
* **Microsoft Excel/CSV** – as data source (if applicable)

---

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Imported energy consumption data from a structured file (e.g., Excel or CSV).
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Cleaned and shaped data using Power Query.
3. **Modeling**: Established relationships between tables and created calculated columns/measures using DAX.
4. **Visualization**: Built dynamic visuals including line charts, bar graphs, slicers, and KPIs.
5. **Insight Extraction**: Analyzed consumption patterns and provided key takeaways.

## 🔍 Key Features

* **Interactive Filters**: Users can filter data by time, category, or region.
* **Trend Analysis**: Displays changes in energy usage over different time frames.
* **Peak Usage Detection**: Highlights high-consumption periods.
* **Custom KPIs**: Tracks total consumption, average usage, and other important metrics.

---

## 🧠 Insights & Conclusion

* Significant spikes in energy usage were observed during weekday mornings and late evenings.
* Certain departments or regions show consistently higher consumption, indicating potential inefficiencies.
* This dashboard serves as a valuable tool for real-time monitoring and strategic energy planning.
